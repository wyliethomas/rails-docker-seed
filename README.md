# README

Im using this seed to start my new rails projects. Im currently using Ruby 3.1.2 and Rails 7.0.4

What you need:

* You need my dev_postgres container on your local

* You need to replace [YOUR PROJECT] with the name of your new rails project

* You will need to run ```docker compose run web rails new .```

* You will need to remove the .git folder and create a new one for your project repo with ``` git init```.

* That should get you started.
